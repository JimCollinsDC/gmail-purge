# Gmail Purge - Email Analysis Tool

A powerful, browser-based tool for analyzing your Gmail emails to help you understand your email patterns, identify large senders, and manage your inbox more effectively. This is a **read-only** analysis tool that never modifies or deletes any emails.

## 🤖 AI-Augmented Development Story

This project showcases the power of **AI-augmented development** through strategic collaboration between human expertise and AI capabilities. Here's how this comprehensive application was built:

### 🎯 Strategic Prompting & Planning

- **Started with high-level vision**: "I want to analyze my Gmail emails by sender and subject"
- **Iterative requirement gathering**: Evolved from basic filtering to comprehensive read-only analysis tool
- **Smart architectural decisions**: Chose browser-based vanilla JavaScript for maximum compatibility and security

### 🏗️ Collaborative Development Process

1. **Foundation First**: Created reusable JavaScript coding standards following Airbnb style guide
2. **Requirements Engineering**: Developed detailed project specifications with legal safety as priority

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Gmail account
- Internet connection

### Installation

#### Option 1: Download and Run Locally

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Click "Sign In with Gmail" to authenticate
4. Choose an analysis preset and click "Analyze Emails"

#### Option 2: Use Development Server

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start

# Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
```

### First Time Setup

#### 1. Google API Configuration (Required)

Before using the application, you must configure your Google Client ID:

##### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create Project" or select an existing project
4. Give your project a name (e.g., "Gmail Purge App")

##### Step 2: Enable the Gmail API

1. In your Google Cloud project, go to **APIs & Services** → **Library**
2. Search for "Gmail API"
3. Click on "Gmail API" and click **"Enable"**

##### Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
2. Click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"** → **"OAuth client ID"**
3. If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen first:
   - Choose **"External"** (unless you have a Google Workspace)
   - Fill in required fields (App name, User support email, Developer email)
   - Add your domain (for development, you can use `localhost`)
4. For Application type, select **"Web application"**
5. Add authorized origins:
   - `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - Your production domain (when ready)
6. Click **"Create"**

##### Step 4: Configure Your App

1. Copy the **Client ID** from the credentials page
2. Open `js/config/app-config.js` in your project
3. Replace `'YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID_HERE'` with your actual Client ID:

   ```javascript
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: 'your-actual-client-id-from-google-cloud.apps.googleusercontent.com',
   ```

#### 2. Application Usage

1. **Authentication**: Click "Sign In with Gmail" and grant read-only permissions
2. **Analysis**: Select an analysis preset (start with "Recent Month" for faster results)
3. **Explore**: Browse senders, subjects, and insights to understand your email patterns

> **Security Note**: The Client ID is safe to expose in client-side code - it's designed to be public and different from Client Secrets.
